# BlazorB2cAuthSample
---
I published this simple project to provide an example on how to achive Azure AD B2C identity integration with a Blazor Server app.  
There is a lot of content out there, but some of them are quite dated.  This solution works with .NET 5 and 6.  
It's also pre-configurd to use the DevExpress Blazor Controls, but is not a requirement for functionality (I included them 
because DevExpress project templates do not include auth options, and it is tripping people up.)

Please set up your B2C directory first and update the appsetting.json and appsetting.Development.json files before giving it a try.
